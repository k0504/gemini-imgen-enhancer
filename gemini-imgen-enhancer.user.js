  //   inner[0][0]  prompt text
  //   inner[0][3]  attachments, in the order the prompt calls image 1 / 2 / 3

  //                turn, [2] rc_<id>, [9] a resume blob present only on an edit
  //                resend

  //                5 plain regenerate, 7 Pro regenerate

  // send; the uuid stopped existing when ProcessFile was retired. See §upload.
  // The two forms must not be mixed: see §shape for what the server charges for

  //           lines are replayed on the next start so nothing is lost.
  //
  //   info()  the one line printed per send whether or not the trace is on:

  // /_/BardChatUi/data/, both carry the same five query keys, and both answer
  // a length-prefixed stream of envelopes whose payload is a JSON document
  // escaped into a JSON string. What differs is the address: batchexecute
  // names its rpc in the query and echoes that name back in the envelope,
  // while a dedicated path carries a null in that slot. Every caller left goes
  // through batchexecute; the null-name reading is kept because ProcessFile,
  // the dedicated path this script used to call, was read that way until the
  // server retired it, and the next one will be read the same way.
  //
  // The payload is passed as a value and serialised here. The wire format
  // nests it as a string inside another JSON document, and doing that at each
  // call site is where the quoting goes wrong.
  //
  // An answer can carry more than one envelope: a generation is streamed as a
  // run of them, and which one holds the finished turn is not fixed, so every
  // one of them is handed back rather than the first.
  // The first drop of each rpc is worth a line; the rest are not. A generation

  // probe, whose send is answered from a conversation of the server's own

  // preview's pixels however the request is phrased: `=s0`, `=d` and `=s4096`
  // all answer 848x1264 where the original is 1696x2528. The original has to
  // come from the conversation.
  //
  // Two things there reach it, and only one of them reaches most images.
  //
  // The pair. An answer that lists both copies declares each one's pixels, and
  // the original is exactly twice the preview - see §origins:read. This is free
  // to use afterwards and answers nothing for an image the answer lists once,
  // which measured as 26 turns out of 189 conversations.
  //
  // The token. Every image the answer lists carries a media token, and the
  // download rpc trades that token for the original - see §library:token. It
  // costs one request at the moment of the download and it answers for every
  // image the conversation still lists: 178 turns of the same 189.
  //
  // Both are written down as answers go by rather than asked for at the moment
  // of the download, because by then the answer may no longer exist. Edit an

  // token, no route at all - reaches that original. Those cards are not marked
