  //                5 plain regenerate, 7 Pro regenerate. The 2 is what files

  // §rpc =====================================================================
  // Gemini answers two kinds of rpc call, and they differ in less than they
  // look. Both post a form of f.req plus the CSRF token to a path under
  // /_/BardChatUi/data/, both carry the same five query keys, and both answer
  // a length-prefixed stream of envelopes whose payload is a JSON document
  // escaped into a JSON string. What differs is the address: batchexecute
  // names its rpc in the query and echoes that name back in the envelope,
  // while a dedicated path carries a null in that slot. Every caller left goes
  // through batchexecute; the null-name reading is kept because ProcessFile,
  // the dedicated path this script used to call, was read that way until the
  // server retired it, and the next one will be read the same way.
  //
  // The payload is passed as a value and serialised here. The wire format
  // nests it as a string inside another JSON document, and doing that at each
  // call site is where the quoting goes wrong.
  //
  // An answer can carry more than one envelope: a generation is streamed as a
  // run of them, and which one holds the finished turn is not fixed, so every
  // one of them is handed back rather than the first.
  // The first drop of each rpc is worth a line; the rest are not. A generation
  // is streamed as a run of envelopes, so an answer that routinely carries one
  // odd chunk would print a line per turn on a channel that is never off.
