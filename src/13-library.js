  // The library page hands out the wrong copy. A card renders the preview key
  // of its image, its download button seeds lh3's download chain with that
  // same key, and a chain seeded with the preview key ends in the 1264x848
  // file however the request is phrased. The two keys share only the fixed
  // `ACRwja` prefix, so the original's seed cannot be derived from the
  // preview's.
  //
  // The original's own seed key is not minted, it is listed. A conversation
  // load answers with both copies of an image side by side under one parent,
  // each declaring its pixels and its byte count, and the original is simply
  // the larger: 2528x1696 against the preview's 1264x848. A chain seeded with
  // that key ends in the full file, which is what a conversation's own
  // lightbox does - `gg/<original>=d-I` and two pointers later, six megabytes.
  //
  //   card -> preview key -> conversation id -> conversation load
  //        -> the larger of the two copies under the same parent
  //        -> lh3 download chain -> the file

  // image edited since is dropped from the conversation while the library
  // keeps its card, and for those the original is not offered anywhere.
  //
  // Neither answer is parsed by index. Their shape is Gemini's and changes
  // without notice, so each is walked as a tree and read by what the values
  // look like: an lh3 URL or a bare key, a token, a triple of numbers.
