  // the conversation's preview nor its original - and it is capped at the
  // preview's pixels however the request is phrased: `=s0`, `=d` and `=s4096`
  // all answer 848x1264 where the original is 1696x2528. The original has to
  // come from the conversation.
  //
  // Two things there reach it, and only one of them reaches most images.
  //
  // The pair. An answer that lists both copies declares each one's pixels, and
  // the original is exactly twice the preview - see §origins:read. This is free
  // to use afterwards and answers nothing for an image the answer lists once,
  // which measured as 26 turns out of 189 conversations.
  //
  // The token. Every image the answer lists carries a media token, and the
  // download rpc trades that token for the original - see §library:token. It
  // costs one request at the moment of the download and it answers for every
  // image the conversation still lists: 178 turns of the same 189.
  //
  // Both are written down as answers go by rather than asked for at the moment
  // of the download, because by then the answer may no longer exist. Edit an
  // image once and the version it replaced is dropped from the conversation
  // while the library keeps its card, and from then on nothing - no pair, no
  // token, no route at all - reaches that original. Those cards are not marked
