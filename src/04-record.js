  // The record outlives the page, and so do the bytes it was drawn from.
  //
  // Keeping only URLs is not enough, because all three kinds expire in their
  // own way: a blob: URL dies with the document that minted it, an lh3 URL
  // answers with a scaled copy and is not always readable under the page's CSP,
  // and a contrib path expires within the day. IndexedDB holds the images
  // themselves, so a restored record can be drawn, and a reference that has
  // gone stale is uploaded again from what is stored rather than refetched from
  // anywhere.
  //
  // What survives a reload is the store's own subject: the bytes are the first
  // source a re-upload reads from, ahead of a contrib that expires within the
  // day and a thumbnail URL that answers with a scaled copy, and the file name
  // a message was uploaded under is held nowhere else on the page. The rule the
  // record serves is stated once, above the three accessors in §record.
  // Two databases rather than two stores in one, and the reason is the upgrade
  // rather than the schema. A second store means a version bump; a version bump
  // waits on every connection an older document still holds; and a wait that is
  // never answered never settles, so one other Gemini tab left open would hang
