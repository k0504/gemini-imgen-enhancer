  // Clearing the whole tuple makes the server answer from a conversation of
  // its own: §net keeps that off the screen and §store keeps the record, but
  // the turn is written to the other conversation and this one never receives
  // it, so a reload gets the message as it was before the edit.
  //
  // Dropping the resume blob at inner[2][9] alone keeps the address and loses
  // the revision. That blob is what is added to the tuple when a message is
  // edited in place, and it is the element that makes the server treat the
  // send as a revision of the edited turn rather than a new one; without it the
  // server appends a new turn under the same parent the edited message hangs
  // from. On a message with a parent that new turn is the one a reload shows,
  // which is why this shape measured well and looked right. On message #0
  // there is no parent: the reload shows the original turn, and the generated
  // image is gone from the conversation and from the library with it. It was
  // shipped that way for a fortnight and taken against a one-message
  // conversation until every image it produced had vanished.
  //
  // So the tuple goes out as Gemini built it. The action and the attachment
  // form are the two differences that can be taken, and 58.0s is the price of
  // a turn that stays.
  //
  // Answers whether the send may go out. hasNew is gone with the route that
  // read it: it decided how much of the fast shape was still worth applying to
  // a list that could not have all of it, and there is no such list any more.
