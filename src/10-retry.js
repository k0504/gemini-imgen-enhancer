  // here is the editor's own resend with nothing changed: the message goes out
  // again as it stands and the server's own resend semantics apply - the new
  // answer replaces the old one and the turns after it are discarded.
  //
  // One press, one resend. This button was armed by a first press and fired on
  // the second, on the reasoning that a stray click must not discard half a
  // conversation - but the same is true of the page's own regenerate, which
  // takes one press, and a control that does nothing the first time is a
  // control that reads as broken. The title says what the press does; that is
  // where a warning belongs.
